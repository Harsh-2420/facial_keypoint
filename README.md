# facial_keypoint
Kaggle dataset for facial keypoint detection.
Cleaned the data separating out the image column into an array to read RGB values and divided the dataset into X and Y values for learning, using a split of 20% for testing.
Finally, implemented a convolutional neural net with three conv layers and two dense layers with a final dense layer for the output.
Yet to implement: Tensorboard to improve accuracy and loss of the model.
